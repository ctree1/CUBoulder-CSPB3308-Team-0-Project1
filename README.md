# Infant Tracking App
## Team members
Connor Tree, Julia Scott, Michael Lamelza, Steven Putt  

## Vision statement
Julia Scott can you take a stab at this? 

## Motivation
Multiple parents in the group, keeping tabs on baby trends is important but tedious to keep up with. The hospital gives you a sheet of paper, spreadsheets are better but not easy to manage when your hands are full. Can't there be an easier way?...

## Risks To Project Completion
1. Working with minimal UI real estate (e.g a watch design)
2. Many languages and frameworks, team has none or some experience in the various areas, i.e. Python, Javascript, HTML5, CSS, Hosting site
3. Multiple team members working on different sections of the code/project

## Mitigation Strategy
1. UI mockups to prototype options for small screens
2. Meetings to discuss skillsets, division of labor, etc.
3. Version control via GIT 

## Development Method
Scrum (weekly meetings for planning and progress) and Kanban (ADO boards to plan user stories, assign work evenly, and stay on track). 

## Project Tracking Software
Azure DevOps (ADO)
